## Task List

1. Read Paper <https://martiningram.github.io/papers/hot-heads-cool-heads.pdf> (no need to focus on details).

2. Look into `R` package book <https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html>. Is this something you're interested in learning? Pros include learning about software tests, function documentation, and the organization that comes with an R package. The biggest con is that time spent learning this means less time spent on the analysis itself. To help decide you can also skim through James Wolpe's SYE project, which was in an R package format (functions are in the R folder, tests are in the tests folder, etc.). <https://github.com/jameswolpe/compr>. 

3. Mess around with data on other git repo (put /data folder in gitignore so it doesn't get pushed to your SYE repo. It's fine to have that data on the courtvisionr repo because that repo is private. But, we'll eventually want to make your SYE repo public, so it shouldn't have that data on there).
